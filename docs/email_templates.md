## Email Best Practices

### ✓ DO:

- Include version information
- Summarize key changes or updates
- Be specific about what feedback you need
- Respect your supervisor's time

- Attach the correct file version
- Keep emails professional but friendly

### ✗ DON'T:

- Expect immediate responses
- Send multiple versions in one day
- Use informal language
- Forget to thank your supervisor
- Submit incomplete work without explanation
- Miss deadlines without prior communication

## Attachment Naming Convention

Always use the file naming generated by the release script:
```
TMDEI_Thesis_[version]_EduardoSousa.pdf
```

Examples:
- `TMDEI_Thesis_draft-2024-10-25_EduardoSousa.pdf`
- `TMDEI_Thesis_v1.0_EduardoSousa.pdf`
- `TMDEI_Thesis_final-2024-10-25_EduardoSousa.pdf`

This naming helps both you and your supervisor keep track of versions.

## Cloud Storage Sharing (Alternative to Email)

If your thesis file is large or you want to share source files:

**OneDrive/Google Drive:**
```
Dear Dr. [Supervisor Name],

The thesis files are too large to email, so I have uploaded them to [OneDrive/Google Drive].

Access link: [your-shared-link]
Password (if applicable): [password]

The folder contains:
- Thesis PDF
- Source files
- Implementation code (if applicable)

The link will remain active for [timeframe].

Best regards,
Eduardo Sousa
